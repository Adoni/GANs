GAN Model Implemented with PyTorch
===

# About this project

In this project, we implement some GAN models like WGAN and Sinkhorn GAN. Our aim is to compare Sinkhorn GAN with other models and try to apply it to conditional GAN.

# Experiments

Right now we take experiments on MNIST and LSUN. The best results of SinkhornGAN is like:
